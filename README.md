## Lookbook v3.0 development branch

Work-in-progress, exploratory rebuild of Lookbook for a future v3.0 release.

[Overview](#overview) ãƒ» [Requirements](#requirements) ãƒ» [Usage](#usage)  ãƒ» [Development](#development) ãƒ» [Key goals](#key-goals)  ãƒ» [Current status](#current-status)


## Overview

The main aims of Lookbook v3 include:

* **UI**: Easier theming, better accessibilty, remove ViewComponent dependency
* **Previews**: ActionMailer previews, preview overview pages, improved error handling and feedback
* **Pages**: More styling and layout customisation options
* Remove ActionCable requirement for live UI updates (use SSE)
* Streamline the Lookbook development and testing process

> See the [key goals](#key-goals) section for more details on the additions, improvements and updates that are planned for this release.

## Requirements

* Ruby >= 3.0.0
* Rails >= 6.1.0

## Usage

### Installation

Lookbook v3 is currently under heavy development and **should not be considered stable**.

However, intrepid indiviuals who are familiar with Lookbook and wish to kick the tyres or get a preview of the upcoming changes can install the Lookbook gem directly from the `v3` branch of this repo:

```rb
group :development do
  gem "lookbook", github: "ViewComponent/lookbook", branch: "v3"
  gem "listen" # Optional but allows faster 'smart' updates when changes occur
end
```

Lookbook will automatically be mounted at `/lookbook` within your app when the server is started.

> **Note:** Previously Lookbook required manual mounting in your app. This is **no longer the case**, so if trialing v3 in a project with an existing Lookbook install you must remove [the mounting code](https://lookbook.build/guide/installation#step-2) from your routes.rb file first.

### Configuration

The currently implemented v3 configuration options are not yet documented, but can be seen in the [config.rb](lib/lookbook/config.rb) file.

> **Note:** If testing out the v3 branch on an existing Lookbook install you may see errors if setting v2.x config options that have not yet been re-implemented in v3.

### Breaking changes

Lookbook v3.0 will contain a number of breaking changes from the v2.x releases.

The majority of these changes will be in the _extending_, _theming_ and _API_ areas, so heavily customised Lookbook installations may find upgrading a more involved process. As yet there is no documentation on the exact scope of these changes.

In addition, until v3 development reaches beta release stage there are likely to be _unintentional breaking changes_ due to missing or partly-implemented features.

For these reasons, it is recommended that anyone who wants to kick the tyres on the pre-alpha v3 codebase do so **on new projects or existing projects with simple, 'vanilla' Lookbook installs** to minimise the chance of running into issues.

### Running in production

Please don't do this. It's really not ready yet.

## Development

### Demo app

Start the demo app in development mode:

```
bin/dev
```

Visit http://localhost:4444/lookbook

> In development mode assets will be rebuilt as changes are made.

### Testing

Integration tests run against the demo app.

Run the tests:

```
bin/test
```

### Logging and debugging

`Lookbook` logs its activity to `Lookbook.logger`.
This is the primary method of debugging.

#### Custom logger

You can call `Lookbook.logger =` to set a custom `Lookbook` logger for the process. For example:

```rb
Lookbook.logger = Rails.logger
```

#### Default logger

If no custom logger is set, a default `Lookbook` logger which logs to to `STDERR` will be created and assigned to `Lookbook.logger`.

The default logger defaults to the `error` logging level (severity).
You can override the logging level by setting the environment variable `LOOKBOOK_LOG_LEVEL=<level>`.
For `<level>`, all standard `::Logger` levels are supported, with any mix of upper-/lower-case:

```bash
export LOOKBOOK_LOG_LEVEL=debug
export LOOKBOOK_LOG_LEVEL=info
export LOOKBOOK_LOG_LEVEL=warn
export LOOKBOOK_LOG_LEVEL=fatal
export LOOKBOOK_LOG_LEVEL=error
```

The default of `error` will be used if an unsupported value is set.

#### Disabling logging

If you want to disable `Lookbook` logging, set

```rb
Lookbook.logger = ::Logger.new('/dev/null')
```

## Key goals

Below are some of the key goals for the Lookbook v3 release. This is a constantly evolving list!

### UI

* Improve accessibilty
* Remove ViewComponent as a dependency, use bespoke component system to build UI (to avoid VC version incompatabilities with parent app)
* Use vanilla CSS instead of Tailwind
* Light and dark modes out of the box
* Better theming system using CSS variables
* Make `<lookbook-embed></lookbook-embed>` a proper web component
* Add status bar for notifications and info

### Previews

* Add support for Mailer previews
* Per-preview overview/documentation pages 
* Improve previews of partials/view templates, ensure they are 100% compatible with how they are used in parent app
* Handle and display parser errors in the UI
* Configurable frame ancestors for preview embeds

### Pages

* More customisation and theming options
* Make linking to other pages and previews easier and more flexible

### Development/Testing

* Include runnable test/demo/development app in codebase
* Make ongoing Lookbook development easier - simpler asset dev/build process, automated releases
* Use Minitest instead of Rspec
* Run tests against demo app
* Ensure good integration test coverage
* Make logging play nicer with standard Rails logging options and third party gems

### Other

* Remove ActionCable requirement, use SSE for live UI updates in dev
* Improve error handling and compatability with `better_errors` etc
* Improve clarity and readability of codebase
* Drop support for older Ruby/Rails versions
