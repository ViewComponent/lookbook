## Lookbook v3.0 [development branch]

This branch contains a work-in-progress, exploratory, from-scratch rebuild of Lookbook, intended to form the basis of a future v3.0 release.

[Demo](#demo-site)  ãƒ» [Usage](#usage)  ãƒ» [Development](#development) ãƒ» [Background & motivation](#v3-rebuild---background-and-motivation) ãƒ» [Current status](#v3-rebuild---current-status)

![CI status](https://github.com/lookbook-hq/lookbook/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=v3)

## Demo site

You can find a hosted version of the [demo/test app](#demo-app) here: https://v3-demo-app.lookbook.build/lookbook

This pulls directly from the `v3` development branch and so may occasionally be broken.

## Usage

Lookbook v3 is currently under heavy development and **should not be considered stable**. 

However, intrepid individuals who are familiar with Lookbook and wish to kick the tyres or get a preview of the upcoming changes can install the Lookbook gem directly from the `v3` branch of this repository.

> Alternatively you can pull down the codebase and [run the included demo app](#demo-app) to see some of the new features in action.

### Requirements

* Ruby >= 3.0.0
* Rails >= 6.1.0

### Installation

Add Lookbook to the `development` group in your Gemfile:

```rb
group :development do
  gem "lookbook", github: "lookbook-hq/lookbook", branch: "v3"
  gem "listen" # Required for 'live' UI updates when file changes are detected
end
```

Mount Lookbook at a path of your choosing in your `config/routes.rb` file:

```rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  if Rails.env.development?
    mount Lookbook::Engine => "/lookbook"
  end
end
```

> The mount path (`/lookbook` in the example above) will be the URL that the Lookbook UI will be made accessible at within your app.

Once everything is installed, start your app as normal.

Assuming your app is running on port 3000 and you mounted Lookbook at the path `/lookbook` then browse to http://localhost:3000/lookbook to view the Lookbook UI.

### Configuration

The currently implemented v3 configuration options are not yet documented, but can be seen in the [config.rb](lib/lookbook/config.rb) file.

> ðŸš¨ If testing out the v3 branch on an existing Lookbook install you may see errors if setting v2.x config options that have not yet been re-implemented in v3.

### Breaking changes

Lookbook v3.0 will contain a number of breaking changes from the v2.x releases.

The majority of these changes will be in the _extending_, _theming_ and _API_ areas, so heavily customised Lookbook installations may find upgrading a more involved process. As yet there is no documentation on the exact scope of these changes.

In addition, until v3 development reaches beta release stage there are likely to be _unintentional breaking changes_ due to missing or partly-implemented features.

For these reasons, it is recommended that anyone who wants to kick the tyres on the pre-alpha v3 codebase do so **on new projects** or **existing projects with simple, 'vanilla' Lookbook installs** to minimise the chance of running into issues.

### Running in production

 Please don't do this. It's really not ready yet.

## Development

### Demo app

The Lookbook v3 codebase includes a runnable dummy/demo app for development and testing purposes.

To run the app, clone the contents of the `v3` branch to your machine and then run the following commands from within the root directory:

```
bundle install
npm install
bin/dev
```

Visit http://localhost:4444/lookbook to view the Lookbook UI.

> In development mode assets will be rebuilt as changes are made but there is not yet any asset live-reloading in place.

### Testing

Run the tests:

```
bin/test
```

> Integration tests run against the demo app.

### Documentation site

Run the docs site locally in dev mode:

```
bin/docs
```

Visit http://localhost:4000 to view the docs. Not much to see there at the moment!

### Logging and debugging

`Lookbook` logs its activity to `Lookbook.logger`.
This is the primary method of debugging.

#### Custom logger

You can call `Lookbook.logger =` to set a custom `Lookbook` logger for the process. For example:

```rb
Lookbook.logger = Rails.logger
```

#### Default logger

If no custom logger is set, a default `Lookbook` logger which logs to to `STDERR` will be created and assigned to `Lookbook.logger`.

The default logger defaults to the `error` logging level (severity).
You can override the logging level by setting the environment variable `LOOKBOOK_LOG_LEVEL=<level>`.
For `<level>`, all standard `::Logger` levels are supported, with any mix of upper-/lower-case:

```bash
export LOOKBOOK_LOG_LEVEL=debug
export LOOKBOOK_LOG_LEVEL=info
export LOOKBOOK_LOG_LEVEL=warn
export LOOKBOOK_LOG_LEVEL=fatal
export LOOKBOOK_LOG_LEVEL=error
```

The default of `error` will be used if an unsupported value is set.

#### Disabling logging

If you want to disable `Lookbook` logging, set

```rb
Lookbook.logger = ::Logger.new('/dev/null')
```

## v3 rebuild - background and motivation

The current Lookbook codebase has grown organically and haphazardly from a few custom ViewComponent preview templates into a standalone Rails Engine gem with support for previewing many different types of components and views.

In order to provide a solid foundation for future development this v3 branch was created with aspirations to improve the quality of the Lookbook codebase, reduce the number of third party dependencies, fix long-standing issues that are hard to address in the current implementation
and explore building out new (and experimental) feature ideas.

More concretely, a number of **key goals** are helping shape the development work:

#### UI

* Improve accessibilty and usability of the app (#17)
* Expose a better theming system using CSS variables (with light and dark modes out of the box)
* Replace ViewComponent dependency with bespoke component system for building the UI

#### Previews

* Add support for ActionMailer previews (#570)
* Implement customisable preview overview/documentation pages
* Fix compatability issues with partial/view template previews (#581, #555)
* Improve handling and logging of parser errors (#593)

#### Preview embeds

* Add more granualar security configuration options for embed iframes (#571)
* Implement `<lookbook-embed></lookbook-embed>` as a native web component

#### Pages

* Make it easier to customise the look and feel of pages
* Expand set of UI and path helpers available in pages

#### Development/Testing

* Streamline Lookbook development process - runnable test/demo/development app, simpler asset dev/build pipeline
* Improve test setup - switch to Minitest, run tests against demo app, better integration test coverage
* Make logging play nicer with standard Rails logging options and third party gems

#### Other

* Remove ActionCable requirement, use SSE for live UI updates in dev
* Improve error handling and compatability with `better_errors` etc (#528)
* Remove some of the madness from codebase ðŸ™ˆ
